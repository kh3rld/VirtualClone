## Esraa's Internship Progress

During my internship, I have been exploring various AI/ML models to improve transcription and automation workflows, mainly focused on speech-to-text conversion and model evaluation.

### üîç What I‚Äôm working on:
- Researching transcription models like Whisper and comparing them to other open-source alternatives.
- Running test cases using different audio files in various languages and accents.
- Documenting issues, performance, and accuracy levels.

### ‚úÖ What worked:
- **OpenAI Whisper** performed well, especially with clean audio.
- Preprocessing the audio (normalizing volume, trimming silence) improved results.
- Smaller Whisper models (`base`, `small`) ran smoothly on local machines.

### ‚ùå What didn‚Äôt work:
- Some models failed due to GPU memory limitations.
- Background noise in recordings significantly reduced transcription quality.
- Other models lacked proper documentation or were hard to set up.

### üìÑ Additional files:
I‚Äôve added a Word document summarizing my full experience:
-  Model comparison notes
-  Observations and useful insights
-  Challenges I faced

More updates and sample outputs will be added as I continue.
