## Esraa's Internship Progress

During my internship, I explored several online and open-source transcription tools and models to evaluate their performance, accuracy, and multilingual support. My focus has been on understanding how different tools handle real-world audio, including noisy environments and multilingual content.

### 🔍 Tools & Platforms I Tested:

1. **Clipto.AI**
   - ✅ Good transcription accuracy and multi-language support.
   - ❌ Free for only 7 days and requires a credit card.

2. **YouTube-Transcript.io**
   - ✅ Completely free and supports multiple languages.
   - ✅ Easy to use with direct YouTube video links.
   - ❌ In bilingual videos, it only detects and transcribes one language.

3. **SubtitleWhisper**
   - ❌ Lacks auto language detection.
   - ❌ Poor transcription quality in my testing.

4. **TurboScribe**
   - ❌ Not free – requires a paid plan.

5. **Gladia.ai**
   - ✅ Best overall performance in my testing.
   - ✅ Detected and transcribed multiple languages in one video.
   - ✅ No need to manually set the language.

### ✅ What Worked Well:

- **Gladia.ai** was the most accurate and flexible tool, especially for multilingual transcription.
- **YouTube-Transcript.io** worked well for free and quick single-language transcriptions.
- Tools that support **auto-detection** of language are especially helpful in real use cases.

### ❌ What Didn’t Work:

- Some tools like **SubtitleWhisper** gave low-quality results or lacked essential features.
- Many platforms (e.g., Clipto, TurboScribe) were limited by pricing models or required payment info.
- Bilingual/mixed-language videos were often a challenge for simpler tools.

### 📄 Additional Files

I will included a Word document with detailed notes and reflections from this research, including:
- Model comparison summaries
- Personal observations
- Challenges I faced during testing

More updates and sample outputs will be added as I continue.
